## general observations

The dataset includes 25 male and 25 female Spanish speakers, each producing the vowels /a, e, i, o, u/ three times. F1 and F2 measurements were recorded for each vowel. On average, females had higher F1 and F2 values than males. A linear model was fitted to examine the interaction between F2 and vowel (predictors) on F1 (dependent variable). The results revealed significant interactions between F2 and each vowel on F1 (p < .001). The regression plot shows distinct vowel clusters with positive slopes, indicating that for each vowel, higher F2 values are associated with higher F1 values.
